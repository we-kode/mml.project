# Project description

[My Media Lib](https://github.com/we-kode?q=mml.&type=all&language=&sort=) is an self hosted media library for your audio files. Host your **own** audio files on **your own server** and stream them in Android or iOS app.
Only registered and authorized phones (clients) have access to your own media library. 

Host the backend on **your own** private server. Build your custom administration and client app with **your own** title, icon and color scheme for your family, friends, members of your organization or your customers.

The project consists of an admin app for desktop, linux or macOS where you can manage your audio files - known as records, admin users, groups, clients and monitor statistics of usage.

The Android and iOS clients can stream records or create own offline playlists.
