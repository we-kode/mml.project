# Groups

A group is a summary of [records](./records) and [clients](./clients). [Records](./records) can be played only by [clients](./clients) which are in the same group. [Clients](./clients) and [records](./records) can be in multiple groups.

:::tip
Before registering clients and uploading records create at least one group. Otherwise the clients will not see any records before you add them into one group.
:::

Groups can be managed in the admin app. A group can be marked as _default_. Default groups will be added automatically when a [record](./records) is uploaded or a new [client](./clients) is registered. [Admins](./admins) can remove default groups before uploading [records](./records) or after adding [clients](./clients).

:::caution Update time
If an admin removes groups or assigns them to a client the change will take effect in abaout an hour.
