# Administration App

The administration app can be used on Windows, macOs or Linux. We do not provide binary releases. You have to build the app by your own.
Before you build your admin app you can [customize ](../customize) it by adding custom icon, title or color scheme.
We will create release tags when new features or improvemnets are available. So you can automate your build by listening on them.

## Build from source

Please check the official flutter homepage to learn on how to build the app for [windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/windows), [linux](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux) or [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/macos).

## First start

### Login

On first start you have to login. To login you need to pass several informations once. In all further logins only username and password must be entered.
One client id and admin user should be [created](../setup/backend#create-first-admin-client-and-user) before the initial admin can login.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Login"
  className="center"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/login_light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/login.png'),
  }}
/>

1. **Username**: Username of the admin.
2. **Password**: Password of the admin user.
   
3. **Client-ID**: The id of the actual admin app [created by the cli](../setup/backend#create-first-admin-client-and-user) of the identiy service.
4. **Servername**: The domain and port of your backend server e.g abc.de:5555. As protocol always https will be used.
5. **App-Key**: [Key for all admin apps](../setup/backend#configure-identity-service) to authoorize against the backend.

### Default group

Create one default [group](../concepts/groups), so [clients](../concepts/clients) and [records](../concepts/records) can be streamed. If no group is available the [clients](../concepts/clients) will not see [records](../concepts/records).
