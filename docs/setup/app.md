# App

The mobile app can be used on android and ios devices. We do not provide binary releases.You have to build the app by your own.
Before you build your app you can [customize](/category/customization) it by adding a custom icon, title or color scheme.
We will create release tags when new features or improvemnets are available. So you can automate your build by listening on them.

## Build from source

Please check the official flutter homepage to learn on how to build the app for [android](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android) and [ios](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios) from source.

## First start

On first start a private/public key will be generated to sign your requests to the backed server.

Enter Your name and register your device by scanning the qr code in the admin app.

You are ready to go.
