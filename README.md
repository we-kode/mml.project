# My Media Lib

My Media Lib is an self hosted media library for your audio files. Host your own audio files on your own server and stream them in Android or iOS app. Only registered and authorized phones (clients) have access to your own media library.

Host the backend on your own private server. Build your custom administration and client app with your own title, icon and color scheme for your family, friends, members of your organization or your customers.

The project consists of an admin app for desktop, linux or macOS where you can manage your audio files - known as records, admin users, groups, clients and monitor statistics of usage.
